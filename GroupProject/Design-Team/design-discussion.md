# Design-discussion
===================

The main pros and cons of the four individual designs are listed here as in team discussion.


## Design 1

> **Pros:**

> - The designed UML is very self-explanatory and easy to navigate.
> - The design demonstrates good use of class inheritance, class organization and methods.
> - An application class is designed to initiate the tournament and fetched the tournament result.

> **Cons:**

> - The design of an user class can be unnecessary in implementation.
> - Inheritance from user class makes player or manager less flexible for attribute changes.
> 


## Design 2

> **Pros:**

> - Detailed structure and methods are designed and simple to follow.
> - Logical relationships between classes are demonstrated and separate classes to represent database entries are designed.

> **Cons:**

> - Over-complicated classes design can cause clutter in implement. Some less-optimal classes only performed one or two operations.  
> - In sufficient use of inheritance to simplify design.
> - Font in UML is too small.

## Design 3

> **Pros:**

> - The simple design can potentially make implementation and maintenance easy. 
> - Entities are clearly identified.  

> **Cons:**

> - The methods within each class are not clearly defined.
> - Some relationships between entities are not explained.
> - It is not clear from the design how players are added and removed.

## Design 4

> **Pros:**

> - The structure is clean with minimal amount of classes.
> - There aren't any unnecessary attributes or operations.
> - The design has a database interface class.
> - Methods are well defined in classes to perform the action.

> **Cons:**

> - It is risk-prone to allow access the database for every class. 
> - This simple design without inheritance can impede the addition of any future functionality.
