## Design 1
![dlee317](../Design-Individual/dlee317/design.png)
### Pros
This was designed so well that I didn't need to look at the design-information file to understand the flow. Good use of inheritance and Class organization, with easy to understand methods.  Made me embarrassed of uploading mine, so it gets my vote. 
### Cons
## Design 2

### Pros
Detailed structure and methods defined in the design-information.md file.  Simple to follow.
### Cons
Seemed like more Classes to implement than needed, some which only performed one or two operations.  That made it feel cluttered, I think it could have been cut down with inheritance.
## Design 3

## Design 4
![rgong3](../Design-Individual/rgong3/design.png)
### Pros
Clean simplistic structure with minimal amount of Classes.  Looks easy to implement and there aren't any unnecessary attributes or operations.
### Cons
The simple design without inheritance might make it difficult to add additional functionality in the future, which I'm guessing the Professor will make us do.
