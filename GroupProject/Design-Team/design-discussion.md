## Design 1
![dlee317](../Design-Individual/dlee317/design.png)

### Pros
This was designed so well that I didn't need to look at the design-information file to understand the flow. Good use of inheritance and Class organization, with easy to understand methods.  Made me embarrassed of uploading mine, so it gets my vote. 
Great design! A application class initiate the tournament class. Tournament results is fetched from TournamentResult class. 


### Cons
Attributes of user and player are not clearly defined. 

## Design 2
![ywang3134](../Design-Individual/ywang3134/design.png)

### Pros
Detailed structure and methods defined in the design-information.md file.  Simple to follow.

### Cons
Seemed like more Classes to implement than needed, some which only performed one or two operations.  That made it feel cluttered, I think it could have been cut down with inheritance.
- Font could be a little bigger.

## Design 3
![jtran46](../Design-Individual/jtran46/design.png)

### Pros
- Simple design that could potentially make implementation and maintenance easier
Great diagram! Match class is clearly identified. Implemented both TournamentManager and TournamentPlayer classes. 

### Con
- Does not clearly define which classes the methods should be implemented in.
- Improper use of relationships
Entities of database should be implemented. Relationship between match and tournament is not explained. 

## Design 4
![rgong3](../Design-Individual/rgong3/design.png)

### Pros
Clean simplistic structure with minimal amount of Classes.  Looks easy to implement and there aren't any unnecessary attributes or operations.
- Methods are in classes that should perform the action
- Has an interface for database
Great diagram! All necessary components identified. Tournament results is fetched from tournament statistics. 

### Cons
The simple design without inheritance might make it difficult to add additional functionality in the future, which I'm guessing the Professor will make us do.
- Seems risk prone with how every class is able to access the database
Add/delete player operation should occur between manager and user. It is not clear that how match list is created by tournament manager.
