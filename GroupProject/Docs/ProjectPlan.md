# Project Plan

**Author**: \<Team 37\>

## 1 Introduction

Team 37 is developing a Tourney Manager application for Android utilizing the Unified Software Process model.  The goal is to meet the customer's requirements as well as implement a design that can accommodate for changing requirements.

## 2 Process Description

**Activity 1**: Software Design
- **Description**:  Utilize Unified Modeling Language to create a diagram that displays the Tourney Manager class structure and the relationship between its classes as well as clearly defines each of the class attributes and behavior.  Attention has to be given to create a design that uses proper object-oriented concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation to restrict access to data or classes to only the entities where it makes sense. 
- **Entrance criteria**: Individual UML diagrams
- **Exit criteria**: Team member feedback, completed Group UML diagram that can handle changing requirements

**Activity 2**:  Planning
- **Description**:  Clearly define a project plan with each member's role in the project.  Develop a use-case model that lists the interactions between actors and the system.  Create a requirements list that will meet the customer's needs.  Create documentation to describe the low-level design and internal structure of the program.  Finally, we need to create a thorough test plan to execute and ensure the functionality of the application. 
- **Entrance criteria**:  completed group UML diagram, team member feedback
- **Exit criteria**: Use Case model, Requirements list, Design document, Project plan, Test plan

**Activity 3**: Implement
- **Description**:  During this step we will release an initial version of the application.  The Tourney Manager application is written in Java utilizing the documentation from previous steps.  At this point the application may only be partially working so we will begin executing the test plan on test cases that are testing already-implemented functionality.
- **Entrance criteria**: group UML diagram, member feedback, Use case model, Requirements list, Design document, Project plan, Test plan
- **Exit criteria**: Initial release of application, Test plan execution started

**Activity 4**: Revision & Completion
- **Description**: The team will finish implementing the code if we still had functionality missing in the previous phase.  We will also revise our code as we discover defects in our test plan execution.  Once a change has been made, regression testing will be performed to ensure we did not break anything else.  If customer requirements change, here is where the code will be modified to accommodate them.  Once the test plan completes execution with an amount of low severity defects that we and the customer are satisfied with, the final version of the application will be released.
- **Entrance criteria**: Initial release of application, test plan execution started
- **Exit criteria**: Test plan complete.  Final version of the application released.

## 3 Team

**Team members**: John Tran, Don Lee, Yu Wang, Rulan Gong

**Roles**: 
- **Project Manager** - Allocates resources appropriately to ensure the plan and design are executed successfully.  Determines what the risks are and mitigates them before they can impact the overall success of the project.  Organizes tasks and prioritizes work to meet deadlines.
- **Developer** - Utilizes their programming expertise to transform the design into code.  Needs to be able to analyze the design diagram and translate that into efficient code that does not waste valuable hardware or software resources. 
- **Tester** - By both manual and automatic means, tests the overall functionality of the code to ensure each behavior is working as intended.  The tester must effectively document any defects, steps for reproduction, and test environments used to aid in debugging.  Once a fix for a defect is found, the tester has to validate the fix.  Testers need to also be strong developers in order to spot problems within the code.
- **Architect** - Comes up with the high-level blueprint of the project and uses their knowledge to select the best tools, hardware and software to proceed with.  Has to communicate the design well enough for the developers to understand.  The architect has to research and stay on top of industry standards and trends. 
- **Business Analyst** - The business analyst works closely with the customer and has to get all the business requirements of the project as well as identify any potential roadblocks that might affect the business.


**Role Table**:

| Name  | Project Manager | Developer | Tester | Architect | Business Analyst |
| ------------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| John Tran  |  ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 
| Don Lee  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

For this project, the team decided that the best course of action to familiarize ourselves with each role is to take turns sharing their duties from week to week.  This allows each member to see first hand that the software development process is truly a team effort requiring each role's contributions in order to result in a successful product.
